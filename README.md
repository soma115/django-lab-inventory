## lab-inventory

lab-inventory is a Django application used to track inventory and orders in the lab.

The admin interface is the primary tool used to create and update item records, but there is a growing collection of views that can be used to browse the database and generate orders in a format that can be sent off to our purchasing department.

lab-inventory is licensed for you to use under the Gnu Public License, version 3. See COPYING for details
